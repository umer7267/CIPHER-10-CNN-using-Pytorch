# CIPHER-10-CNN-using-Pytorch
In this notebook, we train a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database.  The images in this database are small color images that fall into one of ten classes. We load in the training and test data, split the training data into a training and validation set, then create DataLoaders for each of these sets of data.
